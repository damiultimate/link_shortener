This is a sample of a web application that contains a homepage and an admin page. The purpose of this project was to create a simple PHP program that acts as a url shortener. The application has several pages with different functions. It has a header page, footer page which makes including pages easier, much like what you'd find in Wordpress. It uses PHP sessions to maintain user data when they are loggedin. Also, it uses the SweetAlert2 library for it's UI information alert system.
